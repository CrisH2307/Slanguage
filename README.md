# 🗣️ What is Slanguage  

**Slanguage** is a web application designed to **bridge the language gap across generations and cultures** by translating slang, memes, and modern expressions into universally understandable language.  

As Gen Z and Gen Alpha continue to shape their own digital dialects through trends and online culture, Slanguage helps users stay connected and communicate clearly — no matter their age or background.
